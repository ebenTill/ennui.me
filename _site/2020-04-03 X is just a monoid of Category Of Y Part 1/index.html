        <p><em>(N.B, the following are understandings resulting from reading the wonderful paper ‘Notions of Computation as Monoids’, the following Haskell extensions are needed: GADTs, TypeOperators, DerivingFunctor)</em></p>
<p>If you’ve ever witnessed someone ask what a monad is, you’ve undoubtedly watched them be hit with a pithy, unoriginal “a monad is the monoid in the category of endofunctors” by some smart arse.</p>
<p>The person who asked is confused, you’re giving up halfway into your twelve page running metaphor on why monads are burritos and you just know the person who derailed the question is wearing a shit eating grin. <em>What does it even mean?</em> First things, first. What is a monoid?</p>
<p>“In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, a monoid is an algebraic structure with a single associative binary operation and an identity element.”</p>
<p>More nerd words, we’re getting nowhere. How about instead</p>
<p>“Take some type of value, define a function that takes two values of this type and returns one of the same type. Also, there’s going to need to be a value that doesn’t really do anything”</p>
<p>Better. In fact, there’s two monoids we’ve been exposed to all of our lives: not only do integers form a monoid with both addition as the binary operation and zero as the identity, they also form one with multiplication with one as the identity. Strings form a monoid with concatanation and an empty string etc. In fact, using a list or the <code>Maybe</code> monad we get monoids for any type for free… but we’re getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>Armed with the above, there’s a few rules to follow to make a lawful monoid: * Associativity. Our binary operation, must always produce the same result no matter the precedence. E.g 1 * (2 * 3) == (1 * 2) * 3 * our identity works on the left: 1 * 0 == 1 * our identity works on the right: 0 * 1 == 1</p>
<p>So what are we to do about this enigmatic endofunctor? Let’s dampen expectations, <em>all</em> functors in Haskell are endofunctors. An endofunctor maps a category to itself, in Haskell everything exists within the category of <code>Set</code>. Ok, let us define a functor: A functor maps morphisms. Or less succintly, given a value in some box, a function expecting a plain value not in a box, we’ll get a new, boxed value of the function applied to the value.</p>
<p>Lists form functors, so let’s think of the list as the box. If we have a list of numbers and we apply a function to this box, we get a new box of numbers. In Haskell, <code>fmap</code> is the function to show a functor mapping <code>fmap (+1) [1,2,3] == [2,3,4]</code></p>
<p>Just like monoids, we have laws to follow: * Identity must be preserved, the functor is of inconsequence. For the integers we have zero as an identity, for functions there is an identity function and it’ll just return any value passed, i.e <code>f(x) = x</code> so, <code>fmap id == id</code> * Function composition does not change, the two must be equivalent <code>(fmap f) ∘ (fmap g) == fmap (f ∘ g)</code></p>
<p>In generalising monoids from our classical understanding on concrete types to over functors, our product changes. The product of functors is composition, i.e <code>Functor f, Functor g =&gt; f (g a)</code>. Declaring a type operator makes this a little more familiar: <code>type (f :*: g) a = f (g x)</code></p>
<p>Now, we also need an identity: <code>data Identity x = Identity x deriving (Functor, Show)</code></p>
<p>Armed with a product and identity, let’s create a new monoid class avoiding any previous definitions. <code>class Functor m =&gt; Monoid' m where   unit :: Identity a -&gt; m a   tensor :: (m :*: m) a -&gt; m a</code></p>
<p>And a generalised algebraic datatype to wrap existing monads <code>data Monad' m a where   M' :: Monad m =&gt; m a -&gt; Monad' m a</code></p>
<p>With this, a function to unwrap the algebraic datatype <code>unM' :: Monad m =&gt; Monad' m a -&gt; m a unM' (M' a) = a</code></p>
<p>Thus, with a definitation of a functor, wrapping any existing monad inside of our new, monad-adjacent instance gives rise to a monoid. <code>instance (Monad m, Functor m) =&gt; Functor (Monad' m) where   fmap f (M' x) = M' (fmap f x)</code></p>
<p><code>instance (Monad m, Functor m) =&gt; Monoid' (Monad' m) where   unit (Identity x) = M' $ return x   tensor (M' x) = M' $ fmap unM' x &gt;&gt;= id</code></p>
<p>If you squint hard enough, you should be able to see that the unit and tensor are nothing more than the <code>return</code> and <code>join</code> functions of a monad.</p>
<p>Monads are monoids and that was exciting back in 2010 but it’s been beaten to death. Now how about applicative functors as monoids in the category of endofunctors?</p>
<p>The paper states that we need to leverage the Day convulution and this takes the form of bifunctors in Haskell. In Haskell, we can define the day convulution as such</p>
<p><code>data Day f g a where   Day :: f c -&gt; g d -&gt; ((c, d) -&gt; b) -&gt; Day f g b</code></p>
<p>The GADT existentially quantifies our <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> for us, takes two functors, a function that operates over tuple of the values and returns a mapping between objects <code>F</code> and <code>G</code>. We’ll define a functor instance to allow mapping</p>
<p><code>instance (Functor f, Functor g) =&gt; Functor (Day f g) where   fmap f (Day x y g) = Day x y (f . g)</code></p>
<p>Our identity still stands, however our natural transformation is now longer via <code>join</code>. Replaced instead by the following</p>
